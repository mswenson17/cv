function [lines, bw] = findLetters(im)
% [lines, BW] = findLetters(im) processes the input RGB image and returns a cell
% array 'lines' of located characters in the image, as well as a binary
% representation of the input image. The cell array 'lines' should contain one
% matrix entry for each line of text that appears in the image. Each matrix entry
% should have size Lx4, where L represents the number of letters in that line.
% Each row of the matrix should contain 4 numbers [x1, y1, x2, y2] representing
% the top-left and bottom-right position of each box. The boxes in one line should
% be sorted by x1 value.

assert(size(lines{1},2) == 4,'each matrix entry should have size Lx4');

assert(issorted(lineSortcheck(:,1)) | issorted(lineSortcheck(end:-1:1,1)),'Matrix should be sorted in x1');
